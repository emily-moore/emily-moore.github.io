## Kangaroo and Emu feeding!

We went to Donnelly River and there they feed wild animals of Oz although they didn't seem that wild because I was able to pet and  feed them out of my hand. I also saw a baby kangaroo which is called a Joey. I also saw emus and emu chicks. The emus were very aggressive over the baby emus.

## Arriving in Oz

It was very strange being on the plane with time racing by because of jet lag. I had dinner straight after breakfast and then suddenly it was midnight! Our first night in Oz was sleeping in a bus in mum's friends property.Their property is about one hundred acres! I love my room because it is on the balcony one window is completly made of glass.
