## Kangaroo and Emu feeding!

We went to Donnelly River and there they feed wild animals of Oz although they didn't seem that wild because I was able to pet and  feed them out of my hand. I also saw a baby kangaroo which is called a Joey. I also saw emus and emu chicks. The emus were very aggressive over the baby emus.

## Road trip

We  set of on a big camping adventure for three or four weeks. 
We set of from Bridgetown to mum's friends in Rollystone we stayed there for four nights. 
We had a bonfire quickly before the fire ban.
The next day we went to rolly pool and I slipped over on the wet rocks.They were so slippery that it was like a water slide.
After our stay in Rollystone we did the long travel to Cue and stayed in a motel called The Lady Of The Murchison it was our last proper bed for weeks.From Cue we were heading to Karajini National Park but we didn't make it and had to camp at mount robinson road stop we were the only people around for miles because we were camping in the desert.

We went to Honeymoon Cove at Point Sampson.The water was beautifully warm and crystal clear!

## Arriving in Oz

It was very strange being on the plane with time racing by because of jet lag. I had dinner straight after breakfast and then suddenly it was midnight! Our first night in Oz was sleeping in a bus in mum's friends property. Their property is about one hundred acres! Now we are staying in Bridgetown with my grandparents. We are going to stay here for the next six months. I love my room because it is on the balcony one window is completly made of glass.
