## Kangaroo and Emu feeding!

We went to Donnelly River and there they feed wild animals of Oz although they didn't seem that wild because I was able to pet and  feed them out of my hand. I also saw a baby kangaroo which is called a Joey. I also saw emus and emu chicks. The emus were very aggressive over the baby emus.
