## Kangaroo and Emu feeding!

We went to Donnelly River and there they feed wild animals of Oz although they didn't seem that wild because I was able to pet and  feed them out of my hand. I also saw a baby kangaroo which is called a Joey. I also saw emus and emu chicks. The emus were very aggressive over the baby emus.

## Arriving in Oz

It was very strange being on the plane with time racing by because of jet lag. I had dinner straight after breakfast and then suddenly it was midnight! Our first night in Oz was sleeping in a bus in mum's friends property. Their property is about one hundred acres! Now we are staying in bridgetown with my grandparents. We are going to stay here for the next six months. I love my room because it is on the balcony one window is completly made of glass.
